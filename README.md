# Giphy-page

https://alla-akiyeva.github.io/Giphy-page/

The app demonstrates the use of AJAX for dynamic loading of content from an API. 

The page has several buttons that are dynamically generated in jQuery from an array. Clicking on a button will load images on a particular topic specified on the button. All images are initally static, but when clicked, an image will animate as a GIF.

The API offset is updated with each click, so new GIFs can be loaded each time the user clicks a button. The user can also add new buttons and use them to load new images.
